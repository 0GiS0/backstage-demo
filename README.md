# Backstage demo

Hi developer 👋🏻! This is my playground around Backstage in order to learn how to configure the different features and integrations we can have for this IDP.

## Getting started

In order to start the project and its dependencies, you can use Dev Containers or GitHub Codespaces.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using Dev Containers, you need to have Docker installed in your machine.
